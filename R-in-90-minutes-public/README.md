# R-in-90-minutes, Public Edition

or 

## The Joy Of Cooking Up Code In R

This repo contains the setup scripts, exercises code, and slides for the public R in 90 minutes course.

By the completion of this 90 minute course taught on rstudio.cloud, students should be able to:

- import data from Google Sheets or Excel
- perform some simple manipulations on that data
- present their data graphically

## Audience
This introductory workshop is targeted at people who don’t know R.

With products like the RStudio IDE, rstudio.cloud, and the tidyverse, RStudio has made R dramatically easier for ordinary people to learn, but few introductory courses employ these tools to their full advantage. We intend this course to fill that gap. In 90 minutes, we will teach attendees how they can apply R and RStudio tools to every day business problems. No prior experience with R or statistics is required.

## Description
While many data scientists eagerly use R in their day to day work, many business people don’t understand that it can be used to help them better understand data. R's command line coding and thousands of add-on packages have frequently left business users feeling like they don't have the time or the energy to learn the language, regardless of how it might benefit them.

However, new learning approaches and services make R much easier to learn today than in prior years. To prove that point, this 90 minute course will teach attendees with no prior programming experience how to:
* Load a data set into R from Google Sheets or Excel
* Perform simple analyses on that data set, and
* Publish graphical results from those analyses to a wider audience.

The class will perform their analyses using the Tidyverse, a single consistent and powerful design philosophy that is now the norm among R users. Students will write their code in the rstudio.cloud integrated development environment (IDE) and publish the results to RStudio Connect (assuming we can resolve a small bug in that connection at the moment). And instead of using an abstract data set (does anyone really care that much about the various species of irises?), we’ll apply our R skills to better understand our own company through data.

## Requirements and Pre-work
Before attending this class, students should create free accounts on rstudio.cloud.

Attendees should have laptops with a modern browser such as Apple Safari, Google Chrome, or Firefox. No software will be installed on attendee laptops. We strongly recommend using an external monitor and your computer laptop screen so that you can see both the videoconference window while working in a full-screen browser window. If you are unable to run two screens, we recommend using the largest monitor available to you for the course.

Attendees will find familiarity with spreadsheets to be helpful in understanding how to work with tabular data. Prior programming experience is NOT required; such experience may create incorrect expectations for some modern R practices and therefore may be distracting.
