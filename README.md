## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will take you on a tour of how to get from
data to manuscript using R Markdown. Starting with a mock medical
dataset, we‚Äôll use R Markdown to combine prose, R code, and figures and
tables created with R code into a nicely formatted and reproducible
final manuscript.

## Learning objectives

1. Learn how to take a mock clinical trial dataset and use RMarkdown to create a reproducible manuscript incorporating tables and figures generated in R.

2. Learn how to easily create a Table 1 and incorporate it into your manuscript.

3. Learn how to create a multipanel figure and incorporate it into your manuscript.

4. Learn how to re-generate your entire manuscript, including figures and tables, after a change in your dataset.

5. Learn how to re-use your figures and tables to easily generate other research products, including a powerpoint presentation and a standard conference poster.

## Is this course for me?

This introductory workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical field who either don‚Äôt know or currently use R Markdown, or perhaps know the basics but aren‚Äôt sure how R Markdown can fit into their research workflow. No prior experience with R Markdown is required.

  - Have you written or collaborated on a medical manuscript to submit
    for publication to a peer-reviewed journal? Are you familiar with
    common components of a medical manuscript like a ‚ÄúTable One‚Äù, other summary tables, plots, text and citations?

  - Have you downloaded and used R a bit? Can you install and load (library) new packages?
    
      - *Even better,* have you used `tidyverse` packages like `ggplot2` and `dplyr`?

  - Have you used R with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)? Are you familiar with the various ‚Äúpanes‚Äù and ‚Äútabs‚Äù? For instance, can you quickly find all objects in your current global environment, and can you send R code from a source file (.R, .Rmd) to the console?
    
      - *Even better,* have you tried to knit üß∂ an R Markdown document to some kind of output format like HTML, PDF, or Word?

## Pre-work

Welcome to the [R Markdown for
Medicine](https://rmd4medicine.netlify.com/workshop/) workshop\! We look
forward to meeting you in person. Before attending the workshop, please
complete the following prework:

<br> <br>

1.  Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at <https://rstudio.cloud/>
    before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google
    or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new
    account with another password you have to remember).

2.  Complete this [10-minute interactive tutorial on
    Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

3.  Please bring a laptop that has the following installed:
    
      - A recent version of R (\>=3.6.0), which is available for free at
        <https://cloud.r-project.org/>
      - A recent version of RStudio Desktop (\>=1.2), available for free
        ([RStudio Desktop Open Source
        License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
      - The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting
        to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command
        line:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` r
    install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "distill", "bookdown",
                       "tidyverse", "here", "janitor", "skimr", 
                       "flextable", "arsenal", "scico", "cowplot"))
    ```

4.  Don‚Äôt forget your power cord\!


On the day of the workshop, I‚Äôll provide you with an RStudio Cloud
project that contains all of the course materials. We will use the
software listed above only as an important backup should there be
problems with the on-site internet connection.
