## Overview

In this four-hour workshop, I will take you on a tour of how to get from
data to manuscript using R Markdown. Starting with a mock medical
dataset, we‚Äôll use R Markdown to combine prose, R code, and figures and
tables created with R code into a nicely formatted and reproducible
final manuscript.

## Learning objectives

\[ADD LEARNING OBJECTIVES\]

1. Learn how to take a mock clinical trial dataset and use RMarkdown to create a reproducible manuscript incorporating tables and figures generated in R.

2. Learn how to easily create a Table 1 and incorporate it into your manuscript.

3. Learn how to create a multipanel figure and incorporate it into your manuscript.

4. Learn how to re-generate your entire manuscript, including figures and tables, after a change in your dataset.

5. Learn how to re-use your figures and tables to easily generate other research products, including a powerpoint presentation and a standard conference poster.

## Is this course for me?

This introductory workshop is targeted at people who work in the medical field who either don‚Äôt know or currently use R Markdown, or perhaps know the basics but aren‚Äôt sure how R Markdown can fit into their research workflow. No prior experience with R Markdown is required.

  - Have you written or collaborated on a medical manuscript to submit
    for publication to a peer-reviewed journal? Are you familiar with
    common components of a medical manuscript like a ‚ÄúTable One‚Äù, other summary tables, plots, text and citations?

  - Have you downloaded and used R a bit? Can you install and load (library) new packages?
    
      - *Even better,* have you used `tidyverse` packages like `ggplot2` and `dplyr`?

  - Have you used R with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)? Are you familiar with the various ‚Äúpanes‚Äù and ‚Äútabs‚Äù? For instance, can you quickly find all objects in your current global environment, and can you send R code from a source file (.R, .Rmd) to the console?
    
      - *Even better,* have you tried to knit üß∂ an R Markdown document to some kind of output format like HTML, PDF, or Word?
