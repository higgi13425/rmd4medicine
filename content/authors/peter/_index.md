Dr. Peter Higgins is the director of the IBD program at the University of Michigan. He received his bachelor's degree and medical degrees from Duke University, and completed a Ph.D. in molecular cancer biology at Duke. He completed his fellowship in gastroenterology at the University of Michigan in 2004, completed an M.Sc. in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, and joined the University of Michigan faculty the same year. Dr. Higgins previously served as the IBD editor for the American Journal of Gastroenterology. His research focuses on inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He is interested in the molecular mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis, which leads to intestinal blockages and surgery. Dr. Higgins studies the use of ultrasound and MRI to measure intestinal scarring, the use of blood biomarkers to detect early scarring, and measurement of markers of early inflammation. His clinical research includes studies on patient-reported outcomes in IBD, medication holidays after long-term remission in IBD, and biomarker-guided therapy in IBD. Dr. Higgins' research interests are complemented by his clinical interest in improving the quality of care of patients with IBD. He is a member of the AGA IBD Quality Measures Committee, and has participated in the development of national guidelines for high quality IBD care. Dr. Higgins has received many honors and awards, including the AGA IBD Clinical Research Excellence Award.
