# Preface {-}

This is being developed for a workshop in September at the 2019 R/Medicine conference. This book is not intended to be a "stand-alone" or authoritative resource on this topic (yet!), nor will it capture all workshop content. This is a book to organize and share ideas and code.

# Workshop outline {-}

1. Introduction (~10 min)
    + Show "first look" Rmd (has all the things: table one, multi-panel plot, etc)
    + *Your turn*
      + Get in groups, introduce, KNIT (to HTML)! Read through Rmd + output, what does it do? Annotate, narrate.
    
1. Session 1: R Markdown Basics (40 min)
    + Basic anatomy of this Rmd doc (4 key components) (~5 min)
    + YAML (~5 min)
    + Markdown (~5 min)
      + Headers
      + Lists
      + Links and images
      + Equations
      + Tables
    + Code (~10 min)
      + Code chunks
      + Inline code
      + Chunk options
    + *Your turn* (~10 min)
      + Change output format in YAML to `distill::distill_article` (note! default global knitr echo = FALSE for this output format!)
      + Change some code chunks to `include=FALSE`
      + I have `echo = TRUE` set as a global option; turn this to `FALSE` then set the most critical code chunks to `echo = TRUE`
      + (Perhaps?) add more meaningful headers and chunk names (then look at in up/down nav and how to show document outline in RStudio)
    + How it all works (~5 min)
    
1. Session 2: Tables (45 min)
    + Change the output format to word! (~5 min)
    + Make table one with `arsenal::tableby()` (~20 min):
        + remember to point out `knitr` code chunk options to `results="asis"`
        + grouped by arm with details on sex and age in each group
        + ungrouped, with stats on BMI, sex, Age in each group
        + control digits
        + export table
    + Consider `flextable` here?
    + *Your turn* (~10 min)

# Uplevels {-}

What are uplevels? The [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Uplevel) gives this definition:

> "Inspired strategic action creating greater capabilities"

We provide uplevels for each workshop section: these are extras we won't be able to cover in the workshop, but are ways that participants can go beyond the workshop materials to see additional ways that they can expand their R Markdown superpowers.

:::rstudio-tip
Through the book, we highlight specific ways that RStudio can expedite your package development workflow, in specially formatted sections like this.
:::

:::tip
RStudio exposes `load_all()` in the *Build* menu, in the *Build* pane via *More > Load All*, and in keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + Shift + L (Windows & Linux) or Cmd + Shift + L (macOS).
